Leela CSS Framework

This is a mishmash of free code and examples given out throughout the Internet.  There's no JavaScript, so who cares.  It's just HTML and CSS.

These are the templates I use to make websites.  They are what they are, and if you want to use them, that's your business.  I don't really care.

There's probably no way to actually release this under a license.

Literally just use view-source to get the code because the people who made HTML are absolutely ridiculous and the CODE tag does NOTHING.
